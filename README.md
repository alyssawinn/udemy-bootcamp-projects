## (PYTHON) Striker Analytics
### Project Background
SportQuest Recruitment, established in 2020, is a global (fictional) recruitment company helping future college players with their college and pro careers.

The company has significant amounts of data related to strikers, encompassing both demographic information and performance metrics. This project thoroughly analyzes this data to create a framework for identifying which metrics predict a top-performing striker.

The raw Excel performance dataset loaded into Jupyter can be found [here](https://github.com/alyssawinn/udemy-bootcamp-projects/blob/main/striker_data.csv). <br>
The Jupyter Notebook file utilized for statistical analysis, feature engineering, clustering analysis, predictive analysis, and visualization can be found [here](https://github.com/alyssawinn/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Striker_Analytics.ipynb).

### Executive Summary
The most significant performance measures to determine a top-performing striker were summed to create a Total Contribution Score. The fields are Goals Scored, Assists, Shots on Target, Dribbling Success, Aerial Duels Won, Defensive Contribution, Big Game Performance, and Consistency. If the total score is above 123.39, the striker is classified as a top performer. This was tested in a logistic regression model to verify how accurate the model predicted a top-performing striker and concluded that it accurately predicted whether a striker was an average or top performer 96% of the time.

### (POWER BI) Website Performance Analytics
Utilizing and analyzing visitors' key metrics while visiting a web page [(dataset)](https://github.com/alyssawinn/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/website_performance_analytics.csv), I've created a dashboard to quickly and easily understand how the website is performing regarding page views, bounce rates, and conversion rates by visitor types, traffice source, and location. The dashboard includes a slicer to filter by the page they exited the site. The Power BI file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/alyssawinn/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/dashboard_project.pbix). <br><br>

### (EXCEL) Business Insights Dashboard
Click [here](https://github.com/alyssawinn/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/558b9b0b95599a0adf0ace9dc3c02c5ec62c86e0/Business%20Insights%20Dashboard%20Project.xlsx) and click 'View Raw' to download .xlsx file and see the results.

Using a dataset of orders, I created 4 PivotTables and a Business Insights Dashboard with the associated PivotCharts showing the following:
 * Average discount rate and profit margin by product category
 * Average sales and quantity sold by region for each product category
 * Total number of products sold from each product category to different customer segments
 * Total amount of revenue for each product category to different customer segments

### (EXCEL) Bank Churn Analysis
Click [here](https://github.com/alyssawinn/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/4bae85ac9f3c1b66afb7fef0dbc743c85cf8375c/Bank%20Churn%20Analysis%20Project.xlsx) and click 'View Raw' to download .xlsx file and see the results.

Using the instructions in the .xlsx file, I analyzed customer bank churn data using PivotTables and the Data Analysis ToolPak to answer the following questions:
 1. What is the average credit score for each country?
 2. How does the average account balance vary between genders within each country?
 3. What is the distribution of active vs. inactive members that own a credit card?
 4. What is the churn rate per number of products used?
 5. What is the average credit score for churned vs. not churned customers across different tenure? (See screenshot below)
 6. Is there any significant difference in average earnings between churned vs. not churned customers?
 7. Is there any significant difference in average credit score among geographic location?
